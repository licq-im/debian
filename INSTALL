Basic Installation of Licq daemon
=================================

Licq installation consists of two main steps:

	1. Install the Licq daemon
	2. Install one or more plugins


Requirements for the daemon:
	- A C++ compiler and libstc++-devel
	- GNU make

	Optional it may be helpful to have these:
	- OpenSSL (for encrypted connections, please read README.OPENSSL)
	- SOCKS libraries (for SOCKS5 support)


These are the installation instructions:

     If there is no "configure" script or you downloaded sources from 
     CVS then use `make -f Makefile.cvs' to create your configure script. 
     You will need autoconf and automake for this to work:
     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/
     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/

  1. `cd' to the directory where you unpacked Licq sources and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

     If you are curious as to what possible configurable options, see
     `./configure --help' for a list of all possible options.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. You have to be 'root' for this to work. Per default 
     files are installed in /usr/local/* if you have not defined a different
     --prefix=/some/directory.
  
  4. `cd plugins' to the plugins directory and install a plugin of your choice.
     Read the included INSTALL and README files to learn how to do this. 
     You need at least _one_ plugin; without a plugin Licq will not
     work!
