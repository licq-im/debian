      LICQ v1.3.0 README
      http://www.licq.org
      #Licq on irc.freenode.net

Please check doc/ for the older README which has detailed instructions!

It has been over a year since the last version of Licq has been released. So 
what took so long?  Well, now there is support for multiple protocols if you 
wish to use them.  Currently only MSN and ICQ/AIM are supported. This involved 
a rewrite of many parts so a lot of work has been put into this version.

In addition, many many bugs have been fixed, please take a look at the CHANGELOG
for a more detailed list.

The MSN plugin is still fairly new and doesn't have many features. What should
work is:

o Single conversations
o Status changes
o List modification (no group management)
o Typing notifications

Enjoy this long awaited release and feel free to come by #Licq! We could use
some more people there, we get lonely :)
