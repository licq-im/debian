      LICQ v1.3.2 README

      #Licq on irc.freenode.net

I'd like to dedicate this release to my grandfather who passed away
on September 23rd, 2005. I have created a small photo album of him with
more information... http://gallery.thejon.org/papa

Please check doc/ for the older README which has detailed instructions!

*** If you have problems seeing user Aliases, run the upgrade/upgrade-1.3.2.pl
script to convert your aliases to UTF8, which is now what is used.

Once again it has been over a year since the last version of Licq, 1.3.0
was released. I have now decided to do my best to keep to a more timely 
release schedule, around 1 release per month. Which should make things
progress more nicely!

In addition, many many bugs have been fixed, please take a look at the CHANGELOG
for a more detailed list.

Enjoy this long awaited release and feel free to come by #Licq! We could use
some more people there, we get lonely :)
