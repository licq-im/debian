      #Licq on irc.freenode.net

Due to some unfortunate bugs in Licq 1.3.7, we decided to make an additional
release this year. This release also adds some new features to the LicqWeb GUI
such as showing recent messages, setting offline status and resizing windows.

For more information on what has changed since Licq 1.3.7, see doc/CHANGELOG.

For general information on how to build and run Licq, see doc/README.
For information about building and using the different plugins, see README or
doc/README for the respective plugins.

We hope you enjoy this release and feel free to come by #Licq to let us know
what you think, get help, help others or just to keep us company.
