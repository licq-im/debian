Development of Licq continues and even though the next main release isn't
quite ready yet, we wanted to give you something while you wait. So we've
taken 1.3.8, fixed a bunch of bugs and present to you Licq 1.3.9.

For more information on what has changed since Licq 1.3.8, see doc/CHANGELOG.

For general information on how to build and run Licq, see doc/README.
For information about building and using the different plugins, see README or
doc/README for the respective plugins.

We hope you enjoy this release and feel free to come by #Licq to let us know
what you think, get help, help others or just to keep us company.
