      LICQ v1.5.0 README

After much work, we are proud to present you with Licq 1.5.0.
Although the big changes are on the inside, this is also the first release to
include support for Jabber protocol and a new OSD plugin based on libaosd.
Other changes include separate auto-logon for each account and the possibility
to override sounds per user or per group.

For building, Licq and all included plugins now use cmake.
The plugin API has undergone major changes to make it easier to use and better
hide the internal parts of Licq from the plugin development. Licq 1.5.0 also
marks the end of the old Qt 3 based Qt-Gui in favour of Qt4-Gui.

The Jabber protocol plugin is based on libgloox and currently supports:
- Sending and receiving messages (including messages received while offline)
- Adding and removing users (including authorization management)
- Typing notifications
- Fetching users vcard
- "Buzzing" users (i.e. sending messages to get the receivers attention)

Notes for upgrading:
- Even though configuration files have changed, Licq will read and reuse
  most of the old configuration.
- If qt/kde-gui was previously used, Licq will automatically switch to
  qt4/kde4-gui on startup if available.
- Due to changes in configuration file format, downgrading back to a previous
  version can cause passwords to loose their first character.

For more information on what has changed since Licq 1.3.9, see doc/CHANGELOG.

For general information on how to build and run Licq, see doc/README.
For information about building and using the different plugins, see README or
doc/README for the respective plugins.

We hope you enjoy this release and feel free to come by #Licq to let us know
what you think, get help, help others or just to keep us company.
