LICQ v1.5.0

An ICQ clone written in C and C++ using a plugin system to allow for
many possible interfaces.
See the webpage (http://www.licq.org) for more information.
Licq implements messages (online and offline), urls, chat, full file
transfer, gui configuration (with the qt4-gui plugin), history as
well as a number of other features.

This program is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, a copy

INSTALLATION:

Please see ../INSTALL.

Licq has been compiled and run successfully on the following systems at one
point (note current versions may no longer compile without a bit of tweaking):
Linux/amd64
Linux/x86
Linux/Alpha
Linux/PPC
FreeBSD/i386
AIX/RS6000
NetBSD/mk68000
OpenBSD/sparc
Sun3/mk68000
Solaris/x86
Unixware
Solaris/sparc

CONFIGURATION:

Configuration is done through the file ~/.licq/licq.conf, which contains .ini
style options.  The contact list is stored in users.conf. 
Each users info is stored as a simple text file called users/<uin>.Licq.
Again, the options are pretty obvious. You can add/remove/edit a user inside 
the gui, or by editing the conf files.

The History file is the file where the user history is stored...
You can specify a filename for each user, or you can put one of the following
keywords in users/<uin>.Licq:
history = none      :keep no history file for this user
history = default   :makes the history file history/<uin>.Licq.history


USE:

Type licq -h for commandline help.

Using licq is fairly straight-forward.  Licq itself is merely a daemon
designed to run various plugin interfaces.  We have written an advanced
gui in qt (qt4-gui) which should be used as the default plugin.  Once you
have compiled and installed Licq, unpack the plugins you wish to use into
the plugins/ directory, compile them, and then install them into
/usr/local/share/licq/plugins (replace /usr/local with the prefix given
to configure if necessary).  Then start licq with the -p option:
$ licq -p qt4-gui -- ...any options to the plugin...

Note the -- which tells the system to pass any options after that on to the
first plugin in the list.  Multiple plugins can be chained in this way:
$ licq -p qt4-gui -p email-forward -- <qt4-gui options> -- <email-forward options>


PROBLEMS:
