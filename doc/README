LICQ v1.3.9

An ICQ clone written in C and C++ using a plugin system to allow for
many possible interfaces.
See the webpage (http://www.licq.org) for more information.
Licq implements messages (online and offline), urls, chat, full file
transfer, gui configuration (with the qt-gui or qt4-gui plugin), history as
well as a number of other features.


LICENSE

This program is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, a copy
of which you should have received with this package.


INSTALLATION:

(If you have a binary distribution then see the FAQ for how to
 do a manual install.  Don't worry it's very easy, any monkey
 could do it.)

1. Type './configure' and it will determine all the right settings and
   directories for your system.
2. Type 'make' and in theory it will build. If you are using a non-GNU system,
   such as FreeBSD or Solaris, you will need the GNU version of make, often
   installed as `gmake'.  If you get errors about "void *" see the FAQ.
3. Type
   su -c 'make install'
   and licq will be installed (defaults to /usr/local).
4. Depending on which GUI you want to use, go to plugins/qt-gui or
   plugins/qt4-gui and follow the directions there (doc/README) to install
   the Qt interface plugin (necessary).

As each user:
5. When you run licq for the first time it will install all the necessary
   files in ~/.licq.
6. You can import users from a number of other clients into Licq using
   one of the conversion scripts found on the download section of the web
   page or in the licq-data package.

Licq requires the following:
Some C++ compiler with proper standard c++ headers.

SOCKS5 Proxy Support:
Licq supports SOCKS5 proxies.  To enable this support, run configure with
--enable-socks5, and optionally --with-socks5-inc=PATH and
--with-socks5-lib=PATH.  Then just make sure all the right environment
variables are set and it should work.  Also read the SOCKS.HOWTO file.

Licq has been compiled and run successfully on the following systems at one
point (note current versions may no longer compile without a bit of tweaking):
Linux/amd64
Linux/x86
Linux/Alpha
Linux/PPC
FreeBSD/i386
AIX/RS6000
NetBSD/mk68000
OpenBSD/sparc
Sun3/mk68000
Solaris/x86
Unixware
Solaris/sparc

CONFIGURATION:

Configuration is done through the file ~/.licq/licq.conf, which contains .ini
style options.  The contact list is stored in users.conf. 
Each users info is stored as a simple text file called users/<uin>.Licq.
Again, the options are pretty obvious. You can add/remove/edit a user inside 
the gui, or by editing the conf files.

The History file is the file where the user history is stored...
You can specify a filename for each user, or you can put one of the following
keywords in users/<uin>.Licq:
history = none      :keep no history file for this user
history = default   :makes the history file history/<uin>.Licq.history


USE:

Type licq -h for commandline help.

Using licq is fairly straight-forward.  Licq itself is merely a daemon
designed to run various plugin interfaces.  I have written an advanted
gui in qt (qt-gui) which should be used as the default plugin.  Once you
have compiled and installed Licq, unpack the plugins you wish to use into
the plugins/ directory, compile them, and then install them into
/usr/local/share/licq/plugins (replace /usr/local with the prefix given
to configure if necessary).  Then start licq with the -p option:
$ licq -p qt-gui -- ...any options to the plugin...

Note the -- which tells the system to pass any options after that on to the
first plugin in the list.  Multiple plugins can be chained in this way:
$ licq -p qt-gui -p email-forward -- <qt-gui options> -- <email-forward options>


PROBLEMS:

See the BUGS file for reports on known bugs and problems.


TROUBLE-SHOOTING:

1. RUNNING
o  Segfault at startup.  If this occurs, run licq with the -d 15 switch and tell
   me how far it gets before segfaulting and I'll try and help. You can report
   such problems to the mailinglist licq-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.

Good luck.
