With version 1.8.0, Licq gets support for multiple accounts per protocol
(currently only for MSN and Jabber). The other big change is the separation of
the ICQ protocol into an optional protocol plugin instead of being built into
Licq. Bugfixes include some stability fixes as well as several minor tweaks in
the plugins to better handle multiple accounts.

Notes for upgrading:
- The first time Licq 1.8.0 is run, The user configuration directory will be
  migrated to a new structure. This is needed to support multiple accounts of
  the same protocol, however it will make the configuration unusable by older
  Licq versions. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO BACKUP YOUR BASE DIRECTORY BEFORE
  UPGRADING TO LICQ 1.8.0 in case you ever want to be able to downgrade.
- Because ICQ is now a separate protocol plugin, it must be built and installed
  separately if ICQ or AIM accounts are used. However, no manual configuration
  changes are needed. During the configuration migration above, Licq will try
  to load the ICQ protocol plugin if it is needed.
- The console plugin has been removed and is no longer supported.
