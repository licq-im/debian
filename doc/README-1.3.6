      LICQ v1.3.6 README

Again it's been almost a year since the last version of Licq was released so to
prove that we're still alive, here is Licq 1.3.6.
This is mostly a bugfix release but with one big exception. The Qt-Gui has been
fully ported to Qt4, gone through a make over and is now available as a separate
plugin.

For more information on what has changed since Licq 1.3.5, see doc/CHANGELOG.

The Qt4-Gui is available as a separate plugin (named qt4-gui) so the old qt-gui
can still be used by those who perfer it or for some reason cannot build against
the Qt4 library.

We consider Qt4-Gui to be the new default GUI for Licq and due to this many new
features will not be implemented in the old Qt-Gui. We will however still
maintain Qt-Gui and keep it working but at this time we cannot guarantee for
how long it will be around.

Just like the Qt-Gui, the Qt4-Gui can also be built with KDE support, however
at this time the KDE 4 support in Qt4-Gui is still experimental and has a few
problems.

For general information on how to build and run Licq, see doc/README.
For information about building and using the different plugins, see README or
doc/README for the respective plugins.

Enjoy this long awaited release and feel free to come by #Licq to get help,
tell us what you think or just to keep us company. Contributions are also
welcome so if you want to make your favourite IM client even better, don't
hesitate to send us your patches. And that doesn't just mean coding, we also
need help to keep the translations up to date.
