      LICQ v1.3.4 README

      #Licq on irc.freenode.net

While Licq is headed in a new direction (see wiki[1], trac[2], blog[3]
for details), a maintenance release of the 1.3 branch has been prepared
with many bug fixes and improvements.

In doc/ there are the previous README files for you to peruse.

*** If you are upgrading from 1.3.0 and have problems seeing user Aliases,
run the upgrade/upgrade-1.3.2.pl script to convert your aliases to UTF8,
which is now what is used.

In addition, many many bugs have been fixed, please take a look at the CHANGELOG
for a more detailed list.

Enjoy this long awaited release and feel free to come by #Licq! We could use
some more people there, we get lonely :) And please remember that we are all
in different time zones (Europe, Asia, America), so some of us are probably
sleeping and won't be there at that time.
