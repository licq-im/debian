Hints for Using Licq

o  Use multiple accounts or just keep multiple user lists by using a
   different base directory by runing licq with -b.
o  You can pass plugins command line arguments simply by 
   appending them to the command line after a --.  ie
   "licq -p qt-gui -- -g MOTIF"
o  Use the licq_fifo file in your base directory (~/.licq) to change your
   status, your auto response, or exit licq remotely or from a script.  See
   The FAQ for details.
o  Create new utilities to perform virtually any operation on a selected user.
   See UTILITIES.HOWTO for more information.
o  OnEvent parameters accept all the % options from the UTILITIES.HOWTO file.
   Use this to for example have licq announce who a message is from using the
   "say" program:
   Command: say
   Message: message from %a
   Url: url from %a
   ...
   You can find "say" in the rsynth package at:
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/speech/rsynth-2.0.tgz
