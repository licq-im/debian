      LICQ v1.7.0 README

      #Licq on irc.freenode.net

Licq 1.7.0 is both a bugfix and feature release.
In the Qt4-Gui, several settings have been moved between dialogs. Notably,
protocol plugins can now be managed directly in the accounts dialog.
Internally, all messages and user data are now handled as UTF8 to reduce
problems when switching encodings. This also affects history files which will
write all messages as UTF8 from now on.

For more information on what has changed since Licq 1.6.1, see doc/CHANGELOG.

For general information on how to build and run Licq, see doc/README.
For information about building and using the different plugins, see README or
doc/README for the respective plugins.

We hope you enjoy this release and feel free to come by #Licq to let us know
what you think, get help, help others or just to keep us company.
