Licq for Debian
===============

If you are using a plug-in package other than licq-plugin-qt, you will
need to either edit your ~/.licq/licq.conf file to specify which one
you want to start with, or start licq with the option "-p <pluginname>",
e.g., if you were using the package licq-plugin-console, but not the qt
package, start licq with "licq -p console".
