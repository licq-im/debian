licq (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Add libqt3-compat-headers to Build-Depends (closes: #181272)
  * Everything is now being compiled with the same libraries as KDE,
    so those with KDE plugins should no longer have issues running the
    QT plugin (closes: #180730)
  * Licq now Depends: licq-plugin-qt | licq-plugin instead of
    licq-plugin-qt2 | licq-plugin (closes: #181209)
  * Apply (modified) patches from Aurelien Jarno
    <aurelien@aurel32.net> to put KDE plugin support back into the
    package.  Thanks to Aurelien, but note that since I don't run KDE,
    I cannot properly test the KDE plugin.  Aurelien has offered to
    help deal with KDE plugin bugs and testing.
    * Update: I've had to comment this back out, because I updating to
      the latest KDE on my build box clobbers a number of other things I
      need due to the recent libvorbis0a switchover.  I'll reactivate at
      some point after this stabilizes -- it otherwise looks clean.
  * Applied patch from Filippo Panessa <kalem@linux.it> to fix
    problems with qinterlacestyle.h and the latest libqt3 packages.

licq (1.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release. (closes: #179417)
  * licq now Conflicts: any version of licq-plugin-qt2.  Having that
    plugin installed was causing segfaults on startup if any UIN data
    was present (closes: #176180, #176173, #176047, #176087, #175995)
  * Builds with g++-3.2, so g++ errors seem to be resolved (closes: #157119)
  * Remove --host from console plugin configure script.  I added this
    a long time ago for a reason, but I can't find it in the changelog,
    and it appears to be the cause of the console plugin breakage, so away
    it goes again.  Thanks to Wellington Seixas Castello for finding
    out what was breaking. (closes: #167965)
  * Build-Depends libssl-dev.  I'm leaving this turned on for the
    moment because I remember getting flamed by upstream for not
    reading all of the documentation the last time I asked about a
    license conflict (it was actually in there).  I've forgotten where
    it is, though, and I can't find it on a quick search. (closes: #171628)
  * Jons GTK plugin has been put back in
  * Autoreply plugin has vanished.
  * All plugins now require a version of licq exactly equal to the
    version of the plugin.  Upstream breaks plugin compatibility too
    often not to do this.
  * Stop creation of blank licq-plugin-qt2 directory in licq-plugin-qt
    package.
  * Build with new qt3 libraries.  This required altering the
    build-dependencies, since things seem to have been split all over
    the place. (closes: #180217)
  * Font shrinkage was probably particular to older KDE or qt libs.
    If still a problem, please reopen (closes: #110213, #172125)
  * i18n should be fine (closes: #157373)
  * Removing users doesn't seem to cause segfaults now (closes: #148467)
  * No problems with AA on the QT plugin now (closes: #90371)
  * Keyboard shortcuts *are* in use in the qt plugin -- they just
    aren't synchronized with the jonsgtk plugin, and they aren't
    likely to be.  This is not something that upstream seems inclined
    to change, as it was forwarded to the list a very long time ago
    without result (closes: #91269)
  * The missing peer to peer mode was corrected a long time ago
    (closes: #90555)

    closes: #168952, as well as #171628)
  * Use admin/config.* from autotools-dev instead of the one brought in by
    libtoolize (closes: #168662)
  * Away status box should be fixed now
    (closes: #174951, #174798, #172773, #175257, #173926)
  * Startup segfault is gone (closes: #167829, #168551)
  * licq now Conflicts: licq-plugin-kde (closes: #167811)
  * Renamed licq-plugin-qt2 to licq-plugin-qt.
    Conflicts/Replaces/Provides used, so it should go up cleanly.

  * I've heard nothing back on an unreproducible segfault in the KDE
    plugin, so I'm assuming it's not an issue.  If someone is still
    seeing it with this version, please reopen. (closes: #157401)
  * Compile against libqt3 (closes: #165467)
  * Accents "Work For Me"(tm) (closes: #98341)  If someone is still
    having problems with accents in the console plugin, please
    reopen.
  * Heavy CPU use on message flash was fixed a long time ago
    (closes: #94334, #100493, #103712)
  * Update build-dependencies to set default -dev dependencies to the
    most recent versions where a virtual package was specified.
  * Build and include Jon's GTK plugin.
  * Autoreply plugin is back.
  * The KDE plugin has been removed.  I can't get kdelibs-dev
    installed on my build machine anymore, and the method for getting
    it built has always been a horrible kludge.  If you want it back,
    get the KDE packages updated, and then send me patches for an
    elegant way to build it alongside the qt plugin.

licq (1.2.0a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libfam-dev to build-depends.  Thanks to Plamen K. Kosseff
    <p_kosseff@prosyst.bg> for pointing it out.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Wed,  9 Oct 2002 15:53:00 -0500

licq (1.2.0a-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rearranged autoconf lines, added an autoheader call, set
    acinclude.m4 not to pull in the extra includes that upstream
    provided, and removed AC_LIBTOOL_CXX from configure.in.  This
    seems to fix the libtool problem without having to copy
    /usr/bin/libtool.  Thanks to Ryan Murray for his help on this.
    (closes: #157081)
  * File transfers are working (closes: #155225)
  * As long as I'm here, close the bugs related to needing to package
    a new upstream version (closes: #155237, #155299)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Aug 2002 15:48:35 -0500

licq (1.2.0a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, official release.
  * Autoreply plugin has vanished.
  * Copy /usr/bin/libtool just before make.  Something is corrupting
    it when it is being generated during configure. I suspect that it
    is a libtool bug, but I don't have time to investigate.
    (closes: #147961).  
  * Added patch from Tim van Erven <tripudium@chello.nl> to remove
    preceding path info from filenames on transfer to prevent file
    sends from overwriting arbitrary files. (closes: #155831)
  * The segfault on message send reported in #154392 was reported in a
    version of licq that I never uploaded, and in any case doesn't
    appear to happen in 1.2.0. (closes: #154392)
  * I have tested an install by hand, and this package seems to work
    fine on woody (closes: #149239)

licq (1.0.4.cvs.20020521-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompile with fixed libtool (closes: #147961)

licq (1.0.4.cvs.20020521-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Well, even if it isn't released, Woody is solidly frozen, so I'm
    uploading new things.
  * New upstream CVS version
  * A number of C++ cleanups in the console, qt, and rms plugins (this
    finally closes: #120490 once and for all I hope).
  * SSL support enabled.  Now Provides, Replaces, Conflicts:
    licq-ssl. (closes: #141812)
  * Since licq-ssl can now be dropped, the fact that the last
    uploaded version of it is obsolete is no longer going to cause
    problems, so this closes: #142564, #146898)
  * SSL support fundamentally conflicts with SOCKS support, which doesn't
    work with free software components anyway.  SOCKS support is therefore
    not going to be turned on in the forseeable future.
    (closes: #111536, #127668)
  * The warning about the licq.conf files having to be recreated from
    scratch is now only shown if the old version number is less than 1.0.
    The message was updated to reflect my suspicion that some versions
    between 0.70 and 1.0 will also break on upgrade.
    (closes: #117279, #59540)
    * The above, as Wichert notes, should really be in Debconf, but if I
      keep putting off fixing little things until I have the time and energy
      to fix them perfectly, they build up and I never get them done at all,
      so I'm doing it this way first.
  * Moved the Recommends: bind9-host to a Suggests, and changed it to
    bind9-host | host.  Also added kmail, ping, queso, traceroute to the
    suggests to match other entries in share/utilities (closes: #138761)
  * Crashing at startup in the KDE plugin should have gone away a long
    time ago. (closes: #99740)
  * Don't do anything in onevent if there is no szParam.  This prevents
    sox/play from complaining when a sound file isn't specified.
    (closes: #96122, #103818, #129280)
    * I am not entirely happy with this solution.  If someone is using as
    a generic command for all events a command that requires no arguments,
    this will cause it to silently fail to trigger.  I am hypothesizing at
    the moment that nobody actually uses LICQ this way.  If I get bug
    reports, I will undo this.
  * Fix spelling error in autoreply description (closes: #125082)
  * Remove plugins/console/aclocal.m4 on clean

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Tue, 21 May 2002 20:45:45 -0500

licq (1.0.4.cvs.20020327-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream CVS version
  * Now packaging Jon's GTK plugin as licq-plugin-jonsgtk -- with luck,
    this will be able to replace the now defunct gtk+licq package.
    * No luck was to be found here.  Removed this again, as it breaks
      trying to find a socks-related function in licq, even if socks is
      disabled.  And no, Dante doesn't work.
  * Randolph Chung <tausq@debian.org> informs me that licq now builds
    perfectly well on hppa, so I can just reset Architecture: any.  This
    does so, and closes: #120490.
  * Random chat bug should be fixed now (closes: #136193)
  * Recommends: bind9-host instead of host (closes: #138761)
  * User profile segfault fixed (closes: #133767)
  * Online notification should be stable by now (closes: #92625)
  * Console plugin: tab on empty line now correctly shows list of
    contacts, instead of segfaulting (closes: #104547)
  * Qt plugin crash fixed a long time ago (closes: #123362)
  * Console plugin: relocation error on search fixed (closes: #138212)
  * I've been told that the segfault on SMS message was fixed some time
    ago.  I can't test this, so if someone knows differently, please
    reopen (closes: #85828)
  * The problem with recurring offline messages was related to the
    protocol change.  Since the cvs version supports the v8 protocol, this
    problem should have gone away. (closes: #118570)
  * Console plugin: /status offline no longer segfaults (closes: #135298)
  * Put the final $(MAKE) distclean after the distcleans on the plugins to
    avoid missing makefiles and impossible cleans.

licq (1.0.4.cvs.20020211-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream CVS version which fixes a remote buffer overflow
    (closes: #133134)
  * Conflicts with existing versions of licq-plugin-gtk+/gnome, since they
    cause the current version of licq to segfault on startup
    (fixes: #108304, #111777, #123031, #126806)
  * Message segfault should be fixed (closes: #98209)
  * Segfault on exit on qt plugin seems to have gone away
    (closes: #81884, #105265)
  * Console plugin no longer segfaults on exit, either
    (closes: #87440, #122229, #117530)
  * Console plugin help now mentions /view (closes: #89248)
  * Missed closing a protocol bug fixed with the previous CVS release
    (closes: #122301)
  * The old mirabilis login servers are no longer used, even if they're
    mentioned in the user configuration file (the name of the parameter
    has changed) (closes: #116758)
  * Updated the conflicts version on the qt2 plugin (closes: #123271)
  * If there ever really was a problem with the qt2 plugin, it's definitely
    changed now... (closes: #110032)
  * I am temporarily dealing with the problems with the hppa building by
    excluding that architecture completely.  Even applying all supplied
    patches won't get it to build, and I'm having some problems
    communicating with upstream right now to get them forwarded anyway...
    (I will change severity and retitle #120490 once this is installed)

licq (1.0.4.cvs.20020205-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Switched to using the CVS version.  The last official release is badly
    broken since it doesn't use the newest protocol, and the older
    protocols have stopped working.
    (closes: #122902, #122686, #125986, #131776)
  * Thanks to Ivan for the NMUs while I was away.  Officially recognize
    the fixes (closes: #118873, #121678)
  * Fix typo in control file (orthers -> others) (closes: #125081)
  * Removed note in the licq-dev copyright file about the qt2 plugin
    having the GPL exception (no longer necessary)
  * Build-Depends: automake instead of automake1.5
  * Run aclocal before libtoolize -f in the configure stage, rather than
    after it.

  * Build with -O0 and -mieee for Alpha (Closes: #121678)
  * Remove unneccesary build-depends as they are already depended upon
    by packages which we build-depend on...ie kdelibs-dev depends on
    libqt-dev which depends on libz-dev and libpng2-dev...so don't depend
    on libqt-dev, libz-dev, or libpng2-dev since we indirectly do already.

 -- Ivan E. Moore II <rkrusty@debian.org>  Sat, 01 Dec 2001 00:34:41 -0700

licq (1.0.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Edit src/optionsdlg.cpp in the qt-gui plugin to check SHARE_DIR
    instead of BASE_DIR for the translations files.  This should clear out
    the remaining problem of translation files being looked for in
    .licq/translations in the qt plugin.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Nov 2001 18:24:41 -0600

licq (1.0.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Default parallelization set to -j 1 for the sake of autobuilders with

  * I've been told that the simultaneous Send/Receive crash bug has been
    fixed (I was never able to reproduce it myself).  (closes: #66075)
  * Bad socket problem fixed ages ago (closes: #81267)
  * hints="Messaging" added to debian/menu file (closes: #98777)
  * Run libtoolize -f as part of the configure step.  Call aclocal as well

    if this is not the case, they were not reproducible here).
    (closes: #88637, #89159)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Mar 2001 17:29:49 -0600

licq (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, despite the fact that it has yet to be announced
    on the main web page.
  * The README for the console plugin no longer makes reference to its own
    version number.  The Debian patch that updated that version number has
    been removed.
  * The plugins now depend on an unversioned licq | licq-ssl, in
    preparation for separate licq-ssl packaging.  I have the nasty feeling
    that removing the version from the dependency is going to come back to
    bite me in the ass, but no simple method for handling an
    =source-version type dependency that won't force licq-ssl to strictly
    match every single release that I make comes to mind...

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Mar 2001 00:21:43 -0600

  * Split the qt2 plugin into licq-plugin-qt2 and licq-plugin-kde
    (closes: #85229, #85231, #84324)
  * New QT2 include and library file locations accounted for.  This puts a

  * Console plugin README patch originally submitted by David Starner (see
    bug#74651) has been accepted upstream.  The version number was still
    listed as 0.20, however, and has been corrected.  This and the
    licq_forwarder README correction have been sent upstream.
  * LICQ should no longer damage or truncate files in out-of-space
    situations (closes: #76815)
  * QT2 plugin crashes should all be gone by now (this is related more to
    QT changes than LICQ changes, however).  (closes: #76465, #78101)

  * Tested that the transmission of extended characters is working
    (closes: #63227, #70433, #72966)
  * Tested that LICQ is properly reporting when you are added to another
    user's contact list (and the user announced it).  It intentionally
    won't happen if you aren't accepting messages from people not on your
    own contact list, and the person adding you is not on your
    list. (closes: #68778)
  * Tested that the black transfer bar no longer disappears on large file
    transfers (closes: #65979)

licq (1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depends: libqt2.2, not libqt2.1 (closes: #75345)
  * Added a note in README.Debian about the odd segfault bugs that keep
    getting reported against licq-plugin-qt2 (and are currently assigned
    to libqt2.2).
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.2.1
  * Debugging option made optional (uncomment the appropriate variable in
    debian/rules)
  * Added a README.Windowmaker to provide a workaround for people having
    problems with two icons or a nonfunctioning icon.  Benjamin Lewis
    submitted the original notes on it; I've rewritten them.  If you use
    Windowmaker and have an improvement on my wording, let me
    know. (closes: #49503, #50216)
  * Compiled against XFree86 4.0.1, now that it's actually in Debian
    proper, which lets me build on my own machine again.  This
    incidentally fixes the problem with the spurious ldso dependency
    (closes: #75224)
  * Whatever problem was involved with licq 0.76 and libqt2.1 is by now
    completely irrelevant.  (closes: #60492)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Nov 2000 17:40:17 -0600

licq (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (closes: #74580, #74581)
  * Changed the licq Depends: licq-plugin to 
    Depends: licq-plugin-qt2 | licq-plugin to get a more expected default
    behaviour for people that install LICQ without specifically selecting
    their plugins (closes: #74727).
  * Console plugin README now mentions that PgUp/PgDn scrolls the main
    window (thanks to David Starner for the wording).  Patch sent upstream
    as well.  (closes: #74651)

  * Oops, REALLY disabled SSL support this time (closes: #72136, #72184)
  * Using the upstream CVS snapshot with the autoreply and forwarder
    plugins that were missing from the CVS imported from 0.85.  This
    seems to fix all of the instability crash problems reported with the
    QT2 plugin.  Theoretically, it was due to -fno-rtti causing licq to
    segfault whenever a plugin called a function that needed it (i.e. the
    QT2 plugin, which acquired the problem from libqt2.2), but I had no
    luck trying to backport the change into 0.85.

  * The autoreply plugin is now v0.17
  * The console plugin is now v0.30
  * The forwarder plugin is now v0.66
  * There is a new rms plugin, at v0.10, but it's not packaged, as I can't
    get it to build reliably (the README for it is also the README for the
    forwarder plugin...)
  * Updated the description

licq (0.81-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * libqt2.1 has finally made it through incoming, so the newer LICQ Qt
    plugins will work now, making this package possible.
  * This is the latest stable upstream version.  The latest devel version
    (0.84b) has plugins that don't compile on my system.
  * The qt-gui plugin version seems synced to the main licq version now,
    and won't be commented on in the future.  None of the other plugins
    have been updated since 0.80.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Jul 2000 13:04:42 -0500

licq (0.80-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The autoreply plugin is now v0.15
  * The console plugin is now v0.21
  * The forwarder plugin is now v0.60
  * The qt-gui plugin is now v0.80
  * src/(daemon)?/Makefile.in is now removed on debian/rules clean
  * The patch to make sure that qt-gui installs its po files is no longer
    needed and has been removed.
  * A few bugs have been fixed by now (closes: #59842, #42201, #49762)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Mar 2000 15:43:48 -0600

licq (0.76-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The autoreply plugin (v0.12) is now compiled and packaged.
  * The console plugin (v0.20) is now compiled and packaged.
  * The forwarder plugin (v0.52) is now compiled and packaged.
  * The shlibs.local file should no longer be needed, so it has been

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Mar 2000 04:31:29 -0600

licq (0.76-2) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Recompile to fix the horrid mess created by the new libqt2 epoch,
    including an important bug against this package.  Closes: #57359

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Mar 2000 11:27:40 -0600

licq (0.76-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Several new features in this version, including random chat support,
    word wrap in history, and auto-popup/auto-raise on incoming message
  * The QT plugin is now version 0.71
  * UIN spoofing re-enabled in QT plugin

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Feb 2000 22:40:43 -0600

licq (0.75.3a-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added local Lintian overrides.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Feb 2000 14:59:56 -0600

licq (0.75.3a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * The QT plugin is now version 0.70.4

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat,  5 Feb 2000 14:28:40 -0600

licq (0.75.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * 0.75.2 fixed a nasty segfaulting bug that 0.71 had, so it needs to go
    into frozen as well...  (closes: #56254)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Feb 2000 09:03:44 -0600

licq (0.75.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * The QT plugin is now version 0.70.2.
  * The locale modules for the QT plugin are now built (closes: #50034)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Jan 2000 13:25:05 -0600

licq (0.71-5) unstable frozen; urgency=medium

  * Tinkered with the Build-Depends line a bit.  Something VERY strange is
    going on here, as the patch submitted by Tommy Virtanen in bug report
    #54475 doesn't match my debian/control file.  My sources don't have a
    Build-Depends on libstdc++2.10-dev, it was on libstdc++-dev.  In any
    case, that has been removed.  Same with the supposed typo of
    zlibg1-dev; on my source tree it was libz-dev (the virtual package).
    (closes: #54475, #52775, #53611)
  * licq-plugin-qt2 now depends on libqt2 libqt2 (>= 2.0.2), libqt2 (<< 2.1)
    via shlibs.local to prevent people from using unofficial libqt2
    versions which are causing the missing symbol errors. (closes: #53243)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Jan 2000 14:17:18 -0600

licq (0.71-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * There is now a proper UPGRADE file.  The two README-x-y files have
    been removed.  Scripts for proper configuration and history conversion
    are in the /usr/share/doc/licq directory.
  * Added a conflicts for licq-plugin-qt2 (<< 0.71) as the versions
    provided earlier than that appear to cause segfaulting. 
    (closes: #51984)
  * Updated to standards-version 3.1.1 (added Build-Depends)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Dec 1999 12:11:07 -0600

licq (0.71-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created a symlink for the missing UPGRADE file for people that can't
    figure out that maybe it refers to the README-0.61-0.70 and
    README-0.70-0.71 files.  (closes: #50450, #50465)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Nov 1999 16:21:25 -0600

licq (0.71-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dpkg-buildpackage for some reason didn't correctly override the
    environment variable for pentium-builder, and 0.71-1 went out
    optimized for i686.  Manually removed the environment variable for
    this build. (closes: #50393, #50403)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Nov 1999 22:24:57 -0600

licq (0.71-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  i18n support is rumored to be much improved
    over 0.70.1a.  Ignore features have also been added.
  * QT plugin is now version 0.67
  * Manpages for (.*)convert have been moved to licq-data (where the
    conversion programs are).
  * WARNING: This version has an incompatable licq.conf and history/*
    format from previous versions.  Backup your .licq directory and delete
    it before activating licq.  UIN files can be safely copied back, but
    not history files.
  * LICQ now aborts if it finds a licq.conf file from an incompatable
    version, forcing you to at least partially follow upgrade instructions
    before starting it.  This is preferred by some users; frankly, I liked
    being able to take my chances if I had to for whatever reason.
    (closes: #50215) 

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Nov 1999 14:41:01 -0600

licq (0.70.1a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * The dots icons are now in the new recommended package licq-data.
  * QT plugin is now version 0.66.2
  * Now recommends sox, which provides /usr/bin/play, which is by default
    used as the player for even sounds. (closes: #48098)
  * Now depends on libqt2, rather than qt2 (closes: #47569, #47652)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Oct 1999 22:23:15 -0500

licq (0.70rel-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The dots icons disappeared from the QT plugin.  Since the website
    claims that they're still included, I'm assuming that they were
    supposed to be and got missed somehow, and reincluding them in the
    package.  The absence can cause startup crashes if you had a 0.70h
    version and had your preferences set to dots.  There were some other
    icon and skin sets included as well, but those are considered distinct
    now by upstream, and will be packaged separately.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Sep 1999 19:20:44 -0500

licq (0.70rel-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version was 0.70 (final).  This is now considered a
    stable release. Since upstream has unfortunately decided to go from
    0.70h->0.70, I've renamed it 0.70rel so that upgrades will happen
    automatically.
  * Segfault on exit has been fixed in this version.
  * The manpages are still not included in the upstream package, and have
    been patched into this one.
  * doc/UPGRADE has been put back in, however, so I removed the patch-in
    for that.
  * QT plugin has gone from 0.66 to 0.66.1
  * debian/rules now uses QTGUI to handle the directory name, so it only
    has to be changed in one spot for future upgrades.  The
    debian/licq-plugin-qt2.docs file still has to be changed each time.
  * Made sure that CHANGELOG.gz was linked to changelog.gz in
    licq-plugin-qt2 as well as licq.
  * Put a #DEBHELPER# into the postinst to prevent my postinst from
    overriding the debhelper-generated one.  This fixes a problem with a
    missing update-menus call and a missing /usr/doc/licq symlink.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Sep 1999 12:03:00 -0500

licq (0.70h-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed reference to /usr/doc in the postinst warning.
  * Not uploaded in favor of working on 0.70rel-1.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Sep 1999 10:50:21 -0500

licq (0.70h-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, classified by upstream as developmental.
    Upstream has finally merged sources for the main program and the QT
    plugin, so it's less messy for me to build the program now.
  * This version depends on QT 2.0, which is in main, so LICQ is being
    moved from contrib to main itself.
  * Switched to FHS
  * This build now correctly depends on only the libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2 
    library (closes: #44389)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Sep 1999 03:47:20 -0500

licq (0.61-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Apr 1999 09:55:52 -0500

licq (0.60.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  
  * I have completely given up on providing a clean
    upgrade path from 0.44, and am simply putting warnings in the
    README.Debian that if you don't read the docs and follow the
    instructions, it *will* break.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Feb 1999 12:51:40 -0600

licq (0.51a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Includes the file.cpp and licq.cpp updates.
  * I took too long, and a new upstream version got released before I
    uploaded, so this never appeared.
	
 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Jan 1999 00:22:23 -0600

licq (0.50alpha1-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  
  * For people that read changelogs, but not READMEs, you have to specify
    the absolute path to sound files, not just a filename.
  * This package includes a minor policy violation in that it places a
    single file directly in /usr/share.  I could move it, but the
    installation routine itself is broken and I want to try to fix one
    thing at a time.
  * This is a private test/courtesy release only, and is not meant for
    inclusion into the Debian distribution.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Dec 1998 12:45:39 -0600

licq (0.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Now that qt1g-dev no longer requires libstdc++2.8, entire package
    recompiled for libstdc++2.9 (fixes bug#29032)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 2.5.0 (no changes needed)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Nov 1998 19:49:21 -0600

licq (0.43-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Commented out two lines in licq.cpp that attempted to install a
    nonexistent sample .uin file to .licq in the user's home directory
    upon a first-time run.  Sent a copy of this fix to the upstream
    author.  (fixes bug #28275)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Oct 1998 02:00:38 -0500

licq (0.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  GPL license has been changed to
    GPL-with-QT-exception-clause, which makes it legal to distribute. This
    is the first version to be packaged for inclusion in Debian (it still
    goes into contrib, though).

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Oct 1998 18:15:24 -0500

licq (0.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  This fixes the problem with ICQ Chat.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Sep 1998 21:00:49 -0500

licq (0.41-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.  Not uploaded.
