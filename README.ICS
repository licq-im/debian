README.ICS

Problem ------------
Your linux box is on a home(uni, school, work) network. you have just
installed licq and suddenly icq dont work.  The computer connected to the
internet that supplys your internet connection is running windows98 with
the Second edition update & it uses the supplyed Internet Connection
Sharing software.

Reason for problem ---------- 
ICS does'n t seem to be able to forward some udp packets. Every now and
again licq will actually connect. This happens when licq trys to use port
1024 I am not sure why but it does happen. Another interesting thing is
that other people will see u to be online every couple of times however
they can not send u messages and u cannot recieve anything.

Soloution ---------
the soloution is fairly simple and straight forward. I am sure there is a
better way but this has worked for me on every version from .72 or
somthing to the latest CVS. 

1) go to www.cnet.com, click on downloads (up the top leftish) the search
for a program called pppshar.

2) download it (it says that it is shareware and expires after 30days
however there is no timebomb and i have been using it for about 8 months.

3) install it (on the windows98SE box that has the net) 

4) open the settings.ini file in the root directory of where u installed
it

5) down the very bottom of the file add the following

#icq
service=icq
map=udp
host=icq.mirabilis.com
listen=4
remote=4000
enable=yes


6) then save and close the file and run PPPshar. as long as u dont get any
errors relating to icq then it sould be fine

7) on your linux box go into your home directory in a console. go into the
.licq dir and open licq.conf file with an editor

change the NumOfServers from 3 to 1
change the DefaultPort from 4000 to 4
change Server1 from icq.mirabilis.com to the IP or Domain of your host
(the win98se box with the internet)

then save the file and close it

restart licq and try to go online

if it dosent work open the network log window 

if it says server send wrong version 0 or somthing thereof make sure
pppshar is working and started.

if it just stalls at connecting to <your IP 192.168.0.1 in my
case) chances are that the icq server is just to busy to let u
on (happens occasionly) wait a few secs and try again.

good luck

if u have any probs at all dont hesitate to ask me
if u work out a better way of acieveing this the i would really love to
know.. ;-)
