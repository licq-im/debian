Licq Jabber protocol plugin
===========================

Adds support for the Jabber (XMPP) protocol to Licq. Jabber is the protocol
used by e.g. Google Talk and Facebook. The currently supported features are:

* Sending and receiving messages
* Contact list management
  - Add/remove contacts
  - Add/remove groups
  - Fetch contact's details, including photo
  - Update your own details, including photo
  - Handle subscriptions (authorizations)
* Typing notifications
* Status messages
* Secure communication

In addition to the requirements that Licq have (e.g. boost), the jabber plugin
also requires gloox: http://camaya.net/gloox/

TODO
----

Major features that would be nice to have, but hasn't been added yet:

* Multi-user chat rooms
* File transfers
* New account registration


Minor features missing:

* Correct handling of self presence with regard to owner photo
  See: http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0153.html#bizrules-resources
* Support XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities


Developer setup
---------------

To test the jabber plugin one needs a jabber server. One such server is jabberd
2.x (http://jabberd2.org/). After installation (on Debian the package is named
jabberd2), all configuration that is needed is to set the hostname and change
the database type to Berkeley DB (db). For details, see:
https://github.com/jabberd2/jabberd2/wiki/InstallGuide-BasicConfiguration

Until Licq supports creating new accounts, you need to use another client to
create one or several test accounts.
