LICENSE

This program is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, with the
exception that it may be compiled and linked with the TrollTech QT
library without implying that any of the rights or restrictions
associated with the GPL are applied to the QT library.


INSTALLATION:

See the INSTALL file within this directory.


CONFIGURATION:

Configuration is done through the qt4-gui/config.ini file in your base dir,
which contains .ini style options.


USE:

Type licq -h -p qt4-gui for command line help.

Using licq is very straight-forward. To access any of the options, just
right click on a user and select the relevant command, or double click on
the user.  A window will open containing a dialog with all the possible
things to do. In this way you can read a new message, check user info,
and send a message all from the same window at the same time.

One key feature of licq is the network status window, which can be viewed
by selecting "Show Network Window" under the "System" menu. This screen
will show you exactly what is occurring at the protocol level.
The menu option "<your alias>" will allow you to view your own settings
and to check system messages.
