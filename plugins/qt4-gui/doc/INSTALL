Basic Installation of Qt4-GUI Plugin for Licq
=============================================

Requirements for Qt4-GUI:
  - X11 header files (xfree-devel or xorg-devel)
  - Qt 4.3.2 or greater. Most distributions come with packages like Qt and
    Qt-devel, you need both, please install the missing ones!
  - A C++ compiler and libstc++-devel.  This compiler must be the same
          version that was used to compile Qt with.  If it is not, you will
          probably experience a crash on startup.
  - cmake 2.4.2 or greater.
  - GNU make


Optional:
  - Hunspell including header files. Provides spell checking in Qt4-Gui.
          Note: If KDE 4 support is enabled, the built in spell checking in
          KDE is used instead.


Building instructions:
  1. Unpack, build and install Licq and any other plugins you need.

  2. Go to the Qt4-Gui directory and make a build directory.
     > cd plugins/qt4-gui
     > mkdir build
     > cd build

  3. Run cmake to generate build files.
     > cmake ..
     By default Qt4-Gui is set to be installed in /usr/local. To specify a
     different base directory specify an install prefix to cmake.
     > cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/licq ..
     To build with KDE 4 support, add -DWITH_KDE=ON to the command line as
     well.

  4. Build Qt4-Gui.
     > make
     Depending on your system, you may have to use gmake instead of make.

  5. Install Qt4-Gui. Unless you specified a base directory where you have
     write privileges you must run this command as root.
     > make install
