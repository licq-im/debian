Licq Remote Management Service Plugin
_____________________________________


QUICK INSTALLATION

To get up and running quickly (assuming you are familiar with loading
plugins for Licq), simple run

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

And then move licq_rms.conf to ~/.licq/licq_rms.conf and edit this
file appropriately.


DESCRIPTION

This program is a remote management server for Licq.


RUNNING

Loading and running the plugin is simply a matter of adding a "-p rms"
to your Licq command line arguments.  Remember that if any plugins are
loaded from the command line then all plugins must be specified.  In other
words if you are using the qt4-gui plugin and also wish to start the rms
plugin, run:
licq [options] -p qt4-gui -p rms -- [ qt4-gui options ] -- [ rms options ]


CONFIGURING

The plugin uses a small configuration file (~/.licq/licq_rms.conf) which must
be set up by hand.  A sample is included with the source, and includes help on
the various settings.


PROBLEMS

If there are any problems, report them to jon@licq.org.
