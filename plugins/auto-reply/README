Licq ICQ Auto Replyer Plugin
___________________________


QUICK INSTALLATION

To get up and running quickly (assuming you are familiar with loading
plugins for Licq), simple run

configure
make
make install

And then move licq_autoreply.conf to ~/.licq/licq_autoreply.conf and edit this
file appropriately.


DESCRIPTION

This program is an ICQ auto replyer.  It is a plugin for the Licq
daemon and must run on it's own.
This program is distributed under the GPL, see the accompanying COPYING
file for more information.
Any events (messages, urls...) received while the plugin is enabled will
cause the plugin to reply with the output from any specified program
(fortune by default).

RUNNING

Loading and running the plugin is simply a matter of running Licq like so:
"licq -p autoreply -- -e -l <status>"

<ststus> is equivalent (and uses the same status strings as)
the fifo command "status" (see the FAQ under FIFO).

For example, to start Licq using the auto replyer and have it start in
enabled mode and logon, run:
licq -f -p autoreply -- -e -l online

CONFIGURING

The plugin uses a small configuration file (~/.licq/licq_autoreply.conf) which must
be set up by hand.  A sample is included with the source, and includes help on
the various settings.
