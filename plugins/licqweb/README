licqweb 1.3.8

To use this you need latest cvs of licq with the rms plugin.

Edit config.php to suit your setup, should be self explanetory. If you want to see offline users, also edit 
licqweb.js, line 22, change
var showOffline = false;
to true.

Something that might need a bit of explaining is the way messages work. If you receive a message
and don't have a window open for that contact, their name will highlight yellow in the contact
list, and the title of the page will change to reflect the number of messages (if you're using
tabbed browsing, which you should be because this is 2005, the title of the tab will change too).
If, however, you already have a window open to that user, you will not get the notification - the
message is displayed straight away in the window area.

If after logging in nothing appears in the contact list, then licqweb probably couldn't communicate
with the php scripts or could not login to rms. Check licq log, web logs, javascript console for
more info. Delete the PHPSESSID cookie or close your browser to relogin.
