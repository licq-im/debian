Getting Qt to work with Skins/Gifs

Note to users of RPM:

If you are having problems with Skins under Licq, it is possible that your
Qt rpm was not build with gif support.  Try finding another rpm, preferably
an official redhat release.


Note to other users:

If you compiled Qt yourself, be sure to add "-gif" to the command line
when configuring, ie run "./configure -gif" instead of just "./configure".
Since QT 3 the correct configure option is "./configure -qt-gif"
