MSN Messenger Icons For Miranda
	by Gico


These icons are ripped from MS' MSN Messenger.
"You like MSN' Interface with its icons? Wait till you see Miranda with them;)"






	Fix for system tray to support high-color icons
	(ripped from nschoot "High Color Mirabilis Icons"-readme):

"Unless you're running Windows ME (and I guess you don't ;-) ) the Miranda system tray icon will probably look ugly because of the 16-color limitation.
I suggest this link to fix your explorer to enable high color icons in the system tray (It's litteraly a matter of flipping a bit): http://www.chez.com/hoiby/TrayIconIn256Color/index.html"





Version History

Fixed some other icons transparancy bug with the lizard skin (now all of them should be displayed correctly).
Enhanched "NA"-icon (centered).



v2.1	Added "On the Phone"-icon (use drag and drop from icon index with the latest nightly builds to use it).
	A "Out to lunch-icon is on the way. Use another icon in the meantime (with the brilliant drag and drop option).
	
	Fixed other transparant bugs

v2.0	Enhanched the "Invisible"-icon. With the Lizard skin there was a transparant bug which would make the icon look ugly 	although it looked fine in the standard Miranda - Fixed now.
	
	Fixed the "Send/Receive"-icon (wrong code) - now it's displayed :p
	
	Switched the "Incoming Url"-Icon for the Internet Explorer-icon (found it better fitting for the fuction)

	
	I can also add the MSN "Message"-icon, but i like Mirandas standard "Message"-icon more.
	If you disagree let me know and i'll add it afterall


v1.a	Added MSN "Send/Receive File" Icon and enhanched "NA"-icon
	Remade Preview Screenshot

v1.0	First Release
