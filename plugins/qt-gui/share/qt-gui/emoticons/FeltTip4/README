*** README ***

Thank you for downloading FeltTip4!

This is the fourth incarnation of the set, and with over twice the number of smilies in the previous version, I hope that it is the best yet. FeltTip is an experiment in the Creative Commons, so by all means: use the smilies in your blog, use them on your web page, port them to your favorite IM client! Read the notes section below for more information.

Enjoy. :)

*** NOTES ***

Please note that the licence has slightly changed for this version. After some discussion with fellow deviant artist Anarres, I have decided to switch the set from the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license to Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike. This change means that now commercial use is not prohibited, but derivative works must be made available under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike license. I think that this will be better suited for the set, and ensure that it remains free (as in speech).

You may modify and redistribute these smilies and incorporate them into your own work to your heart's content, as long as you "share alike," releasing changes under the same license as this set. Please read the LICENSE file and visit the Creative Commons web site for a precise definition of the rights granted to you for this set. If you'd like, let me know how you've used these smilies - I'd love to see what you do with them! If you'd like to use these emoticons in something beyond the scope of the licence, just ask- send me an email. Chromakode@gmail.com

Included is a python script I have written to render the full set and doctor it up a little. This should work on a Linux system with ImageMagick, Inkscape, and pngcrush installed. You may also, as with the set, do what you wish with this script, heck, use it in your own emoticon set!

These emoticons were created entirely using open source software on Linux. SVGs were done in Inkscape, and the final pngs were processed with the script. I recommend Debian, especially Ubuntu Linux.

Why the name? Everaldo (an infamous artist in the open source world), who created the crystal set, once said that there are 3 tiers to the icon world: Windows, with it's cartoony look, OSX with it's heavily realistic and photographic look, and Crystal, which fits in between. One day I was thinking of trying something different, and the name that I finally came up with and liked was FeltTip. As you can see, it's not that far off from the cartoony/crystalish look of Everaldo's artwork- though you could say it also resembles windows' cartoon-style artwork.

*** ACKNOWLEDGMENTS ***

EnjoyDiary.com: In addition to sponsoring this version of FeltTip, EnjoyDiary has contributed greatly to the diversity of these icons. When Lexidh of EnjoyDiary first sent me their list of requested smilies, I was struck by the sheer creativity of their smiley requests. Their ideas, such as the addition of -little and -very to mark intensity, as well as their naming style, have greatly added to the set. They truly provided the how and why of FeltTip4. Go check them out!

deviantArt: deviantART and it's community have been very influential to my art. They keep me motivated to continue and improve, and cultivate the Chroma side of Chromakode.

Inkscape: Inkscape is the software used to make these smileys, and I am very grateful to the developers for creating and continuing to improve this way cool open source vector program.

Spacejunk: You can thank Space for the "batman" smiley in this set, as well as many others over the time. His refusal to accept a Batman with blunt ears, as well as his beta testing and critique since day one of version one earns him his place here.

Mazel: During the time of creating this set, my beloved cat Mazel passed away. I will always see a bit of her in the "furry" icon. Rest in peace.
