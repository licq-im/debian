These nice icons were created by me in order 
to match my taste what licq should look like ;-)

The file "icons.thomas.tar.bz2" contains some
sources in Gimp's native file format. 
Unfortunately i don't have all the files as xcf,
but feel free to use all icons/xcf-files under 
the terms of the GPL.
