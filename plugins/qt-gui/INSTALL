Basic Installation of Qt-GUI Plugin for Licq
============================================

Requirements for Qt-GUI:

  - X11 header files (xfree-devel)
  - Qt 3.0 or greater Most distributions come with packages like Qt and
    Qt-devel, you need both, please install the missing ones!
  - A C++ compiler and libstc++-devel.  This compiler must be the same
          version that was used to compile Qt with.  If it is not, you will
          experience a crash on startup.
  - GNU make

Qt can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/pub/qt/source 
(search for qt-x11-free-xxx.tar.gz).


These are the installation instructions:

     If there is no "configure" script or you downloaded sources from 
     CVS then use `make -f Makefile.cvs' to create your configure script. 
     You will need autoconf and automake for this to work:
     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/
     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/

  1. `cd' to the directory where you unpacked Qt-gui sources and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.
     If you want KDE support, use --with-kde and please read README.KDE !!!

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. You have to be 'root' for this to work. Per default 
     files are installed in /usr/local/*


KDE-SUPPORT:
============

     If you want to have KDE support, please type
     `./configure --with-kde' and then proceed with step 2. Please read
     README.KDE for further details!

NOTE:
=====

If you get errors like

     Unable to load plugin (qt-gui): /usr/lib/licq/licq_qt-gui.so:
     +undefined symbol: dragEnterEvent__14QMultiLineEditP15QDragEnterEvent.

or similiar (text after "undefined symbol: " might vary) then you have
a older Qt 2.x lib in the paths given in /etc/ld.so.conf. uninstall them or
make sure that the Qt 3.x lib is found first.

If you get compilation errors in a file named "*.moc", then you're most 
likely using the wrong moc compiler. You need the one shipped with your 
Qt 3.x version.
NOTE some distributions rename it to "moc2". use --with-qt-moc=<path>/moc2 
to fix this.

If you set the QTDIR environment variable to point to your Qt 3
installation before running ./configure, everything should run through
just fine: 
     
     `export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3'

Take a look at the other README's as well.
