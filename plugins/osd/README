Licq On Screen Display
______________________


QUICK INSTALLATION

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install


DESCRIPTION

This is a small licq-plugin, which uses libxosd2 to
display new arriving messages as OSD (On Screen Display)
text on your desktop. 
I wrote this, as I saw this feature in sim and wanted
to have the same functionality in licq.

If you have any problems with this plugin, please take a look at
http://licq-osd.sf.net, if there is a newer version available.
licq will ship with the newest version available on release (of licq)
Any bugfixes between releases will be done on the project page.

Localization:
licq-osd messages are since version 1.2.7.3 translated. Anyways,
there are only a few translations available, so you will have to look
if your language is supported. (Languages are listed in po/CMakeLists.txt)
If it is, just set LC_MESSAGES correctly using
  export LC_MESSAGES=de_AT
Warning: if LANG is set, then the settings of LC_MESSAGES wont take effect.
in this case you would have to set LANG instead.
If you want to add a translation simply contact me at martinmaurer@gmx.at

ERROR message:
error: Unable to create xosd object: 5 lines: Default font not found

if you get this error you most likely have a configuration problem 
regarding your locales. Try 
unset LANG
unset LC_CTYPE
licq

if it works then, rebuild the correct locales. In debian do "dpkg-reconfigure locales"

XOSD Outline problem:
libxosd as of version 2.2.2 has a few problems drawing text outline correctly.
It should be fixed with one of the next versions, but for now you can
use the patch "xosd-2.2.1-fixed.patch" for fixing it in the xosd sources.

one common Problem:
If you have problem with displaying certain characters 
(umlauts in germany,austria, ...), be sure you have set the correct
LC_CTYPE and configured the locales correctly. 
This is NOT the same problem as stated in the TODO file.
example (when locales are set up correctly):
in a shell type:
export LC_CTYPE=de_AT
licq
