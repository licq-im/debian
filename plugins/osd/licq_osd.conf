# when we logon we get all the users who are online at the moment
# as an logon event. Usually you don't want to show all of them in a row
# (especially when wait = true), but only the ones who log on / off while
# you are online.
# note that this timeout is used when the plugin is loaded AFTER logon
# (via plugin manager). This is a side effect of this hack.
